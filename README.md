# resizeArtwork
Allows resizing of artwork in MP3 IDv3 tags. This is especially handy, when ran on a USB drive that will be used in a car, which often is unable to user large artwork images.

## Requirements
* Python 2.7
* mutagen, pillow (install using *pip install mutagen pillow*)

## Usage
I use the following workflow
* Sync the desired music to a USB drive or SD card. I'm using MediaMonkey, and in *Tagging* options, **Sync all Artwork to file folders** is checked, and the value is set to *folder.jpg*
*
